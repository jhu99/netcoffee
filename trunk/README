Description
This file is README file of the package of NetCoffee, developed by Jialu Hu.
To guide you quickly starting to use our alignment tool, we structured this README into four parts:
1) PREREQUISITE
2) COMPILING
3) OPTION
4) EXAMPLE 
Before running this program, you are strongly recommended to read this file carefully.

################################################################################
PREREQUISITE
1. LEMON Graph Library 1.2.3
The source code is freely available under Boost Software License, Version 1.0 on http://lemon.cs.elte.hu/trac/lemon/wiki/Downloads
Please copy the LEMON library directory into "./include/" after you compile the code.
Note that it's necessary to compile the lemon library under the same machine on which you want to compile NetCoffee.
We provide a lemon library which was compiled on X86-64 machine. If you have a differrent machine, you have to compile the lemon library again.
2. FSST package
This package is necessary only if you want to use "-analyse" option to calculate the semantic similarities.
It can be download at http://gotax.bioinf.mpi-inf.mpg.de/avail.php.
3. GoTermFinder
This package is necessary only if you want to use "-analyse" option to draw the GoTree View or calculate p-Value of each match-set.
It can be download at http://search.cpan.org/dist/GO-TermFinder/lib/GO/TermFinder.pm.

################################################################################
COMPILING
To compile the source code, the latest standard language C++11, also known as C++0x, is needed. Other older compiler may not support it.
Under Linux, you can simply comiple it by run command:
./make MODE=Release
If you want to compile it in Debug mode, run command:
./make (MODE=Debug)

################################################################################
OPTION
You can see the detailed option information with option "-h".
It is noted that there are two options you must specify if you want to run NetCoffee for an alignment task. They are described as follows:

1. -profile
The default file is "./profile.input", but you can also change the filename and path by "-profile" option.
This file tells the program where to find the dataset and to create output files.
It is expected to be in two-column tab-delimited format.
These lines starting with "#" will be seen as comment.
Each line has one keyword and one value, like this:
$keyword	$value
Using this file, you are allowed to set options (network,gofile,efile,alignmentfile,avefunsimfile,scorefile,logfile) here.
However, you are also allowed to set these option in command line, except for these keywords: network, gofile, efile, which containing multiple files.
Note that, the values must be strictly in order from up to down for keywords "network, gofile, efile".
For example, suppose we have
three PPI networ:1.tab, 2.tab, 3.tab,
go association file: 1.fsst, 2.fsst, 3.fsst,
six balst value files: 1-1.cf, 1-2.cf,...,3-3.cf,
then the profile should looks like:
--------------BEGIN OF PROFILE--------------
#COMMENT $keyword	$value
network  ./dataset/1.tab
network  ./dataset/2.tab
network  ./dataset/3.tab
gofile  ./dataset/goa/1.fsst
gofile  ./dataset/goa/2.fsst
gofile  ./dataset/goa/3.fsst
efile  ./dataset/1-1.cf
efile  ./dataset/1-2.cf
efile  ./dataset/1-3.cf
efile  ./dataset/2-2.cf
efile  ./dataset/2-3.cf
efile  ./dataset/3-3.cf
scorefile     ./dataset/score_composit_4s.model
alignmentfile ./result/alignment_netcoffee.data
avefunsimfile netcoffee_fsst.result
logfile       ./result/measure_time.txt
--------------BEGIN OF PROFILE--------------


2. -scorefile
The default file is "./dataset/score_composit_4s.model". This file was empirically obtained from blastp scoring files for othologous model and null model.
You can run commandline with option "-record -task 0" to generate this data with blastp scoring files.

Usage:
  ./bin/aligner -version|-records|-alignment|-analyse|-format
     [--help|-h|-help] [-alignmentfile str] [-alpha num] [-avefunsimfile str]
     [-beta num] [-nmax int] [-numspecies int] [-out] [-profile str]
     [-recordsfile str] [-task int] [-threshold num]
Where:
  --help|-h|-help
     Print a short help message
  -alignment
     Execute the alignment algorithm.
  -alignmentfile str
     The filename of alignment which is required to either create or analyse.
  -alpha num
     Prameter controlling how much sequence similarity contributes. Default is 0.8.
  -analyse
     Make analysis on alignmenr result.
  -avefunsimfile str
     The filename for functional similarity of alignment.
  -beta num
     Probability for randomly picking out the alignment records. Default is 1.0
  -format
     Process input or output file into proper format.
  -nmax int
     The parameter for SA algorithm N.
  -numspecies int
     Number of the species compared. Default is 4.
  -out
     Print the alignment result into file.
  -profile str
     Profile of input parameters.
  -records
     Generate alignment records file.
  -recordsfile str
     Records file for writing and reading. It is used to store the triplet edges in NetCoffee program.
  -task int
     Complete different tasks. It must be used with -alignment option together.
  -threshold num
     Threshold gamma which is used to exclude match-sets with score below a certain value. Default is 0.0.
  -version
     Show the version number.

EXAMPLE
1. Download dataset
Our dataset are freely available on http://ftp.mi.fu-berlin.de/jhu/NetCoffee/dataset.tar.gz .
Download it into the folder of source code and uncompress it with command:
tar -zxvf dataset.tar.gz
2. Compile source code
Compile the source code with command:
make MODE=Release
3. Run NetCoffee on the dataset with command:
./bin/aligner -alignment -task 1 -out
4. Analyse coverage of the alignment result with command:
./bin/aligner -analyse -task 0
5. Analyse consistency of the alignment result with two command (FSST package and gene association files are needed):
./bin/aligner -analyse -task 1
./bin/aligner -analyse -task 2

Then you can find the output files in ./result/ .
There are many other functions which you can see with "-help" option.
