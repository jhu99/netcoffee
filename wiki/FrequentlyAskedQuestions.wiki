   * Does *NetCoffee* also solve the pairwise alignment problem? 
      No, it doesn't align two networks, since it employs a triple approach to score topological edges in bipartite graphs. Unexpected errors might happen if there are only two input networks in the "profile.input" file. 
   
   * Do I have to modify "score.bmode" or "score.mode" when it was used for other data sets?
     We suggest no. But you are allowed to use another scoring model if you like, that's why we leave it as an option for you. 

   * Does it support Mac OS X?
     Yes, it does. The source code can be compiled with compilers g++-4.6 or higher and MS Visual Studio 11.
